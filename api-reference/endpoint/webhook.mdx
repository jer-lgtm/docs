title: 'Job Status Webhook'
openapi: 'WEBHOOK /jobs/webhook'
---

Receive real-time notifications when your compute jobs change status.

## Authentication

Webhook requests from Comput3 include a signature in the `X-Comput3-Signature` header for verification:

```bash
X-Comput3-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

## Webhook Payload

Comput3 sends a POST request to your configured webhook URL when job status changes:

```json
{
  "event": "job.completed",
  "job": {
    "id": "job_123abc",
    "status": "completed",
    "model": "deepseek-v3.1",
    "result": {
      "text": "Hello, world! How can I help you today?",
      "tokens_used": 42
    },
    "completed_at": "2024-01-01T00:10:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Event Types

- `job.queued`: Job has been queued for processing
- `job.running`: Job has started processing
- `job.completed`: Job has completed successfully
- `job.failed`: Job has failed with an error
- `job.cancelled`: Job has been cancelled

## Verifying Webhooks

Verify webhook authenticity using the signature:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(f"sha256={expected}", signature)
```
