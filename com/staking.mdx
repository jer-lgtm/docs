Stake your COM tokens through Streamflow's secure staking protocol to earn continuous access credits for Comput3 Network services. This guide covers everything from basic staking to advanced strategies.

## Staking Overview

COM token staking through Streamflow is the primary mechanism for accessing Comput3 Network services without traditional payments. By locking your tokens in Streamflow's secure staking protocol, you earn credits that can be used for API calls, GPU compute, and media generation.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Earning Rate">
  **Credits earned per day based on staked amount**
  
  ```javascript
  // Credit calculation formula
  dailyCredits = stakedAmount * baseDailyRate * periodMultiplier * tierBonus
  
  // Example: 1000 COM staked for 90 days
  dailyCredits = 1000 * 0.4 * 1.5 * 1.0 = 600 credits/day
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Usage Rates">
  **Credit consumption for different services**
  
  | Service | Credit Cost | Example Usage |
  |---------|-------------|---------------|
  | Chat API Call | 0.1 credits | 6,000 calls/day |
