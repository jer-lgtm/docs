The COM token is the native utility token of the Comput3 Network, designed to provide decentralized access to AI computing resources through a staking-based model.

## Overview

COM tokens enable users to access Comput3 Network services without traditional payment methods by staking tokens to earn compute credits and priority access.

## How COM Token Works

### Staking Model

<Steps>
<Step title="Acquire COM Tokens">
  Purchase COM tokens from supported exchanges or earn them through network participation.
  
  <Info>
  COM tokens are available on major DEXs and centralized exchanges.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Stake via Streamflow">
  Stake your COM tokens through Streamflow's secure staking infrastructure to begin earning access credits.
  
  <CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Streamflow Integration" icon="stream">
    Comput3 uses Streamflow's battle-tested staking protocol for secure token management.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Proven Security" icon="shield-check">
    Streamflow's audited smart contracts ensure safe staking and unstaking operations.
  </Card>
  </CardGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Earn Credits">
  Staked tokens automatically generate compute credits that can be used for API calls and services.
  
  <Check>
  Credits are earned continuously while tokens remain staked.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Use Services">
  Use your earned credits to access AI models, GPU instances, and other network services.
</Step>
</Steps>
